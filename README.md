# r_swg_integration
R scripts to further analyse the data exported from PostgreSQL and ArcGIS on subfield areas that should be converted to switchgrass. 

The csv files are exported from ArcGIS and include results of areas that should be managed in switchgrass according to different scenarios.

swg_area_yield_cutoffs.Rmd shows results of areas in switchgrass, assuming different yield cut offs (for corn and soybean, refering to each year separately).
